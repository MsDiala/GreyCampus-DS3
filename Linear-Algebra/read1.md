This Lecture Note is divided into 4 parts; they are:

    1. Linear Algebra
    2. Numerical Linear Algebra
    3. Linear Algebra and Statistics
    4. Applications of Linear Algebra


# 1. Linear Algebra
    > Linear algebra is a field of mathematics that is universally agreed to be a prerequisite to a deeper understanding of machine learning.
    Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics, but the truth of it is that linear algebra is the mathematics of data. Matrices and vectors are the language of data.

# 2. Numerical Linear Algebra
    The application of linear algebra in computers is often called numerical linear algebra.

    it is more than just the implementation of linear algebra operations in code libraries; it also includes the careful handling of the problems of applied mathematics, such as working with the limited floating point precision of digital computers.

    Computers are good at performing linear algebra calculations, and much of the dependence on Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) by modern machine learning methods such as deep learning is because of their ability to compute linear algebra operations fast.

    Three popular open source numerical linear algebra libraries that implement these functions are:

        1- Linear Algebra Package, or LAPACK.
        2- Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms, or BLAS (a standard for linear algebra libraries).
        3- Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software, or ATLAS.


    The name of one of more of these underlying libraries may be familiar to you if you have installed or compiled any of Pythonâ€™s numerical libraries such as SciPy and NumPy.


# 3.Linear Algebra and Statistics
    Linear algebra is a valuable tool in other branches of mathematics, especially statistics.

    Some clear fingerprints of linear algebra on statistics and statistical methods include:

        - Use of vector and matrix notation, especially with multivariate statistics.
        - Solutions to least squares and weighted least squares, such as for linear regression.
        - Estimates of mean and variance of data matrices.
        - The covariance matrix that plays a key role in multinomial Gaussian distributions.
        - Principal component analysis for data reduction that draws many of these elements together.
    As you can see, modern statistics and data analysis, at least as far as the interests of a machine learning practitioner are concerned, depend on the understanding and tools of linear algebra.

# 4. Applications of Linear Algebra
    As linear algebra is the mathematics of data, the tools of linear algebra are used in many domains.
