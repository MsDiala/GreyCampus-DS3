    - readLines : for reading lines of a text file.
    - source : for reading in R code files (inverse of dump).
    - dget : for reading in R code files (inverse of dput).
    - load : for reading in saved workspaces.
    - unserialize : for reading single R objects in binary form.

# Data Visualization(ggplot2)

    Grammar of graphics 2 principals

    Graphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements

    Meaningful plots through aesthetic mappings


# Essential grammatical elements

    Data : The dataset being plotted

    Aesthetics : The scales onto which we map our data

    Geometries : The visual elements used for our data

    Facets : Plotting small multiples

    Statistics : Representation of our data to aid  understanding

    Coordinates : The space on which data will be plotted

    Themes :  All non-data ink
